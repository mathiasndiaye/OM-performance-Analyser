**Performance OM Club Analyzer**

**This project is designed to fetch and analyze data on the performance of the OM Club in Ligue 1 using an API.**

**Getting Started**
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

**Prerequisites**
The following packages are required to run this project:

   requests (for making API calls)
   pandas (for data manipulation and analysis)
   matplotlib (for data visualization)
   JSON (to manage JSON files)
   
You can install these packages using pip by running the following command: pip install library


**Data source**
